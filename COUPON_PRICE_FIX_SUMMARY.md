# Coupon Code Price Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
**Problem:** Coupon codes were not using the correct price amount when redeemed. Users would redeem a code with a specific amount (e.g., ₦750) but the system would default to ₦500 for stake amount and reward calculations.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by **inconsistent field naming** between different parts of the system:

1. **Admin Panel (`admin-codes.html`)** stores coupon data with `amount` field
2. **Script.js redemption logic** was looking for `price` field
3. **Old admin functionality in script.js** was using `price` field

This mismatch meant that when codes were created through the admin panel with an `amount`, the redemption logic couldn't find the `price` field and defaulted to ₦500.

## Files Modified

### 1. `script.js` - Main Fixes

**Fixed redemption logic:**
```javascript
// OLD (broken):
if (accessCodes[code].price && !isNaN(accessCodes[code].price)) {
    stakeAmount = accessCodes[code].price;

// NEW (fixed):
const codeAmount = accessCodes[code].amount || accessCodes[code].price;
if (codeAmount && !isNaN(codeAmount)) {
    stakeAmount = codeAmount;
```

**Added migration function:**
```javascript
function migrateAccessCodes() {
    const accessCodes = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('quizAccessCodes')) || {};
    let migrated = false;
    
    for (const code in accessCodes) {
        if (accessCodes[code].price && !accessCodes[code].amount) {
            accessCodes[code].amount = accessCodes[code].price;
            delete accessCodes[code].price;
            migrated = true;
        }
    }
    
    if (migrated) {
        localStorage.setItem('quizAccessCodes', JSON.stringify(accessCodes));
    }
}
```

**Updated code generation to use `amount`:**
```javascript
// OLD:
price: codePrice,

// NEW:
amount: codePrice,
```

**Added fallback for input field detection:**
```javascript
const codePriceInput = document.getElementById('code-price') || document.getElementById('code-amount');
```

## How the Fix Works

### 1. **Backward Compatibility**
- Supports both old codes (with `price` field) and new codes (with `amount` field)
- Automatic migration converts old `price` fields to `amount` fields
- Fallback logic: `accessCodes[code].amount || accessCodes[code].price`

### 2. **Consistent Field Usage**
- All new codes use `amount` field consistently
- Admin panel and script.js now use the same field name
- Input field detection works with both `code-price` and `code-amount` IDs

### 3. **Complete Flow Integration**
- Coupon redemption sets correct `stakeAmount`
- Reward calculation uses the correct stake amount: `stakeAmount * multiplier`
- Payout submission includes the correct reward amount

## Testing Results

✅ **All tests pass:**
- New codes with `amount` field work correctly
- Old codes with `price` field are migrated and work correctly
- Edge cases (invalid amounts, zero amounts) default to ₦500
- Complete flow from code creation → redemption → reward calculation works

## Expected Behavior Now

1. **Admin creates ₦750 code** → Stored with `amount: 750`
2. **User redeems code** → `stakeAmount` set to 750
3. **User scores 95%** → Reward = 750 × 10 = ₦7,500
4. **User scores 80%** → Reward = 750 × 2 = ₦1,500

## Verification Steps

### Quick Test:
1. Open `admin-codes.html`
2. Create a code with ₦750 amount
3. Use the code in main quiz app
4. Check that stake amount shows ₦750 (not ₦500)
5. Complete quiz and verify reward calculation

### Comprehensive Test:
1. Open `test-complete-coupon-flow.html`
2. Create codes with different amounts
3. Test redemption and reward calculations
4. Verify all amounts are used correctly

## Files for Testing

- **`test-coupon-price.html`** - Basic coupon price testing
- **`test-coupon-fix.js`** - Node.js test script
- **`test-complete-coupon-flow.html`** - Complete flow testing

## Migration Notes

- **Existing codes** with `price` field will be automatically migrated to `amount` field
- **No data loss** - migration preserves all existing functionality
- **One-time migration** - runs automatically when codes are accessed

The coupon code price issue is now completely resolved with full backward compatibility and comprehensive testing.
